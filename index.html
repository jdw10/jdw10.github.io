        <h2>Professional Experience</h2> 
          
        <li>In the 3rd year I started a sweet business. It started initially from a friend wanting a pack of mints I had in my locker.
           I only had 50 cents in my pocket , with the 50 cents i bought mints which I sold for one euro making a 50 cent profit.
           I had to sell about 5 packs of mints before i was able to make a profit. 
           I also introduced sweet called fizzy belts with a drink fizzy peach water which where an immediate hit and sold well.
           There where a few products which did not sell well such as strawberry jellies and henry the hippo jellies.
           With that information I understood that jellies are not a fan favourite.
